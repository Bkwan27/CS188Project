## Environment

It is recommended to activate your own anaconda or python virtual environment. Then do 'pip install -r requirements.txt' and you should be able to run the code.

## Code
 
PPO training code, reward function, and evaluation is in the PPO branch. Dense reward function for PPO is under PPO branch in env.py. Training code for lift task PPO is under PPO branch in main.py. Training code for door task PPO is under PPO branch in door_main.py.

If you want to evaluate your trained RL algorithm run python eval.py.
